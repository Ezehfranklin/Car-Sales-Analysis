CAR SALES ANALYSIS: TRENDS AND INSIGHTS

OVERVIEW

This project explores a comprehensive dataset of car sales, focusing on identifying key patterns in sales performance, pricing, and manufacturer trends. The objective is to provide actionable insights to help car manufacturers and dealerships optimize their strategies and offerings based on data-driven evidence.

KEY OBJECTIVES
1. Analyze sales volumes and manufacturer performance.
2. Study price distributions and their relationship with attributes such as horsepower and fuel efficiency.
3. Investigate correlations between various car attributes to uncover trends.

Data Summary- 
Source: Kaggle.
- Scope: 157 records, 16 attributes including sales volume, price, horsepower, fuel efficiency, and resale values.
- Key Columns:
  - `Sales_in_thousands`: Sales volume of cars.
  - `Price_in_thousands`: Price of each car.
  - `Horsepower`: Power rating of the vehicle.
  - `Fuel_efficiency`: Efficiency in miles per gallon.
  - `Year resale value`: Projected resale value after one year.
  - 
METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Addressed missing values by replacing averages for certain columns.
   - Removed null entries and standardized column names.
2. Analysis Techniques:
   - Grouped data by manufacturer to compare average sales, pricing, and efficiency metrics.
   - Visualized trends through bar charts, line plots, and correlation heatmaps.
   - Computed descriptive statistics to highlight data distributions.
3. Assumptions:
   - Dataset is representative of car sales trends.
   - Attributes like price and horsepower significantly influence customer preferences.

KEY FINDINGS
1. Sales Insights:
   - Certain manufacturers consistently lead in sales volumes, attributed to popular models or strong branding.
   - Pricing and horsepower significantly affect sales performance.

2. Correlation Analysis:
   - A strong positive correlation between `Price_in_thousands` and `Horsepower` indicates higher-priced cars tend to have more powerful engines.
   - Moderate relationships were observed between other attributes, such as `Curb_weight` and `Fuel_capacity`.

3. Manufacturer Comparisons:
   - Fuel efficiency and pricing varied significantly across manufacturers, showcasing differences in value propositions.

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Manufacturers with lower sales should:
   - Reevaluate pricing strategies.
   - Focus on enhancing fuel efficiency to cater to Eco-conscious customers.
2. Future analyses could include:
   - Long-term trends over time, such as the impact of new launches on pricing and sales.
   - Consideration of additional factors like geographic regions and customer demographics for more tailored insights.

LIMITATIONS
- The analysis is based on a limited dataset; larger datasets could yield more comprehensive insights.
- No predictive modeling was implemented, leaving potential for advanced analyses.
